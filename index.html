<a id="questions-solved" class="anchor" href="#questions-solved" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions solved</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Write a program to find the greatest number among the list of numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program to reverse a string/number where user should be able to input the values</p></li>
<li><p>Ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius. The program should print a message based
on the temperature:
(a) If the temperature is less  than -273.15, print that the temperature is invalid because it is
below absolute zero.
(b) If it is exactly -273.15, print that the temperature is absolute 0.
(c) If the temperature is between -273.15 and 0, print that the temperature is below freezing.
(d) If it is 0, print that the temperature is at the freezing point.
(e) If it is between 0 and 100, print that the temperature is in the normal range.
(f) If it is 100, print that the temperature is at the boiling point.
(g) If it is above 100, print that the temperature is above the boiling point.</p></li>
<li><p>A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, except that years divisible by 100 are not leap years
unless they are also divisible by 400. Write a program that asks the user for a year and prints
out whether it is a leap year or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program that asks the user to enter a list of integers. Do the following:
(a) Print the total number of items in the list.
(b) Print the last item in the list.
(c) Print the list in reverse order.
(d) Print Yes if the list contains a 5 and No otherwise.
(e) Print the number of fives in the list.
(f) Remove the first and last items from the list, sort the remaining items, and print the
result.</p></li>
<li><p>Start with the list [8,9,10]. Do the following:
(a) Set the second entry (index 1) to 17
(b) Add 4, 5, and 6 to the end of the list
(c) Remove the first entry from the list
(d) Sort the list
(e) Double the list
(f) Insert 25 at index 3
The final list should equal [4,5,6,25,10,17,4,5,6,10,17]</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program that uses a dictionary that contains ten user names and passwords. The
program should ask the user to enter their username and password. If the username is not in
the dictionary, the program should indicate that the person is not a valid user of the system. If
the username is in the dictionary, but the user does not enter the right password, the program
should say that the password is invalid. If the password is correct, then the program should
tell the user that they are now logged in to the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program rotates the elements of a list so that the element at the first index moves
to the second index, the element in the second index moves to the third index, etc., and the
element in the last index moves to the first index.</p></li>
<li><p>Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string of the form 'Number of 
donuts: ', where  is the number passed in. However, if the count is 10 or
more, then use the word 'many'  instead of the actual count. So donuts(5) returns
'Number of donuts: 5' and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many' </p></li>
<li><p>Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars of the 
original string,  so 'spring' yields 'spng'. However, if the string length is less than 2, return 
instead the empty string.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a list of strings, return the count of the number of strings where the string
length is 2 or more and the first and last chars of the string are the same.</p></li>
<li><p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 
6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. write a program to find the sum of all the 
multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p></li>
<li><p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two 
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four 
million, write a program to find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a code to remove duplicates in an array of numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a code to generate a random no in a range from min to max?</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17. Find the sum of all
the primes below two million.</p></li>
<li><p>Given two arrays, 1,2,3,4,5 and 2,3,1,0,5 find which number is not present in
the second array.</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.</p></li>
<li><p>write a program ( in any programming language ) to Compute the area and perimeter of a 
circle with radius 3 using function .[Given pi= 3.14, Area= pi<em>(r</em>r) , perimeter= 2<em>pi</em>r]</p></li>
<li><p>greeting = "Hello Google!" number of character in greeting stored in the variable 
'number_of_char' and repeat the greetings based on the number of character in 'greeting'</p></li>
<li>
<p>Write a program that reads an integer N (1 &lt; N &lt; 1000). This N is the number of output lines 
printed by this program.
Input
The input file contains an integer N. (Sample Input : 5)
sample output
1 1 1
2 4 8
3 9 27
4 16 64
5 25 125</p>

<hr>
</li>
<li><p>Write a function that validates the password. It should be 6-8 characters long. It consists of 
alphanumeric characters with a mixture of digits and letters.</p></li>
<li><p>Read two numbers M and N indefinitely. Calculate and write the sum of their factorial. Be 
   carefully, because the result can have more than 15 digits.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Input
The input file contains many test cases. Each test case contains two integer 
numbers M (0 â‰¤ M â‰¤ 20) and N (0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 20).
Sample Input
4 4 
0 0 
0 2
Sample Output
48
2
